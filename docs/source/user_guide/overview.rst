Birdspotter is primarily used in a browser, like any other website or web application. 
The primary function of the application is to help manage aerial population data, with 
the ability to import image and shapefile data and visualize such data.
Data can be uploaded in the form of a .zip of shapefiles (.shp and .shx), or a raw .tif file. 
At this time, only shapefiles can be visualized, while tiffs are only stored. 
In the future, analysis of the shapefile via a trained AI algorithm will also be supported.

Datasets can be renamed, and notes can be added to the datasets. By default, they are visible only to the user 
that uploaded them, though they can be made public. Dataset visualization includes a map view, with 
each data point overlayed over a satellite image-based map, as well as a series of aggregate graphs, 
showing the distribution of population, behavior, etc.
