Birdspotter is primarily used in a browser, like any other website or web application. 
The primary function of the application is to help manage arial bird population image data, with the ability to import both geotiff and shapefile data, and visualize such data.
Data can be uploaded in the form of a zip of shapefiles, or a raw tiff file. At this time, only shapefiles can be visualized, while tiffs can only be stored. 
At some time in the future, analysis of the shapefile via a trained AI algorithm will also be supported.

Datasets can be renamed, and notes can be added. By default, they are visible only to the user that uploaded, though they can be made public. 
Dataset visualization includes a map view, with each data point overlayed over a satallite image-based map, as well as a series of aggregate graphs, showing the distribution of population, behavior, etc.
